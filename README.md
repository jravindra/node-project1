## Features

### Echo Server:

```bash
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9000 -d "hello self" -H "x-asdf: yodawg"
* Rebuilt URL to: http://127.0.0.1:9000/
* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 9000 (#0)
> POST / HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.37.1

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< user-agent: curl/7.37.1
< host: 127.0.0.1:9000
< accept: */*
< x-asdf: yodawg

### Proxy Server:

Port 9001 will proxy to the echo server on port 9000.

```bash
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:9001/asdf -d "hello proxy"
* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 9001 (#0)
> POST /asdf HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.37.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:9001
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 11
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
> 
* upload completely sent off: 11 out of 11 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< user-agent: curl/7.37.1
< host: 127.0.0.1:9001
< accept: */*
